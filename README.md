# geometry-api-java

The Esri Geometry API for Java can be used to enable spatial data processing in 3rd-party data-processing solutions.  Developers of custom MapReduce-based applications for Hadoop can use this API for spatial processing of data in the Hadoop system.  The API is also used by the [Hive UDF’s](https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-for-hadoop) and could be used by developers building geometry functions for 3rd-party applications such as [Cassandra]( https://cassandra.apache.org/), [HBase](http://hbase.apache.org/), [Storm](http://storm-project.net/) and many other Java-based “big data” applications.

## Features
* API methods to create simple geometries directly with the API, or by importing from supported formats: JSON, WKT, and Shape
* API methods for spatial operations: union, difference, intersect, clip, cut, and buffer
* API methods for topological relationship tests: equals, within, contains, crosses, and touches

## Instructions

Building the source:

1. Download and unzip the .zip file, or clone the repository.
2. Deploy the esri-geometry-api.jar to the target system, add a reference to it in a Java project.
3. To build the jar, Javadoc, and run the unit-tests, run the “ant” command-line command from within the cloned directory. The ant tool runs the “build.xml” script which creates the jar, runs the unit tests, then creates the Javadoc documentation files.

The project is also available as a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.esri.geometry</groupId>
  <artifactId>esri-geometry-api</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Requirements

* Java JDK 1.6 or greater.
* [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) build system.
* Experience developing MapReduce applications for [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/).
* Familiarity with text-based spatial data formats such as JSON or WKT would be useful.
