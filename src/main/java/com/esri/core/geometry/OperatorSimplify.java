 * Simplifies the geometry or determines if the geometry is simple. The goal of the OperatorSimplify is to produce a geometry that is

 * The Geoprocessing tool CheckGeometries should accept geometries
 * produced by this operator's execute method. For Polylines the effect of execute is the same as
 * IPolyline6.NonPlanarSimplify, while for the Polygons and Multipoints it is same as ITopologicalOperator.Simplify.
 * For the Point class this operator does nothing, and the point is always simple.

 * The isSimpleAsFeature should return true after the execute method.
